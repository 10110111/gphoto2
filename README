To build you will need besides the common build tools:

Optional:
- The EXIF library. (libexif-devel, libexif-dev or similar)
- The JPEG library. (libjpeg-devel, libjpeg-dev, or jpeg-dev or similar)
- The CDK library (for ncurses based configuration UI). (cdk-devel or similar)
- The AALIB library (for ascii art rendering of previews). (aalib-devel or similar)

How do I test it?
------------------

  * make check

The test suite checks the installation and basic functionality of the gphoto2
program and the 'Directory Browse' libgphoto2 camera driver.
